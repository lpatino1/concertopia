# Project 1: Concertopia Web App

Please find our deployed app here: https://lpatino1.github.io/project-1/

## Description

Concertopia is a web app for music lovers and concert goers!  Search for your favorite musical artists, see fun information about them like:
- their top-played songs on Spotify
- lyrics to popular songs
- find out if your favorite artist is playing any shows or events near you
- watch a music video of theirs on YouTube

The purpose of this project was to practice collaboration with fellow web developers and show comprehension and proficiency in the following coding concepts: 

- deploying and linking multiple server-side web API's
- third-party CSS frameworks (Materialize) 
- saving to local storage
- utilizing GitHub for collaboration and app deployment
- user interactivity

Our app, Concertopia allows users to quickly and easily find fun and functional information about their favorite artists.  This includes popular songs, song lyrics, whether the artist is playing shows or events nearby, and can even link users to a music video of their favorite songs.  

This project was very educational for our team, as we tested different API's with various levels of public accessibility.  We landed on the following API's: 
- The Audio DB
- Lyrcs.ovh
- Open Cage Data Geocoder
- TicketMaster Discovery Map Widget 

## Installation

There are no installation steps to follow before using Concertopia.  Simply follow the deployed link above, type in your favorite artist, allow the app to access your location if you like, and enjoy the music!
